# Agnostic Tokens for DaisyUI

## Overview

The Agnostic Tokens for DaisyUI project is dedicated to creating a versatile and powerful design system by tokenizing the DaisyUI component library. DaisyUI, built on Tailwind CSS, enhances this framework with an elegant and flexible component set, making it an ideal candidate for tokenization. The project's goal is to provide designers with a comprehensive tokenized theming system that remains platform-agnostic, enabling use across various tools, including Figma, Adobe XD, and Penpot.

The system is structured into four key levels:

1. **Core Level (Tokens):** Foundational design tokens for sizes, colors, typography, and shadows.
2. **Theme Level (Tokens):** Semantic tokens that adapt core tokens for different themes (e.g., light, dark).
3. **Component Level (Tokens):** Tokens applied to UI components, ensuring consistency and reusability across designs.
4. **Styles (Specific to Figma):** Streamlines the design process by linking component variables to Figma styles for easy updates.
